## **Usage Recommendations**

### **For eDiscovery and Compliance Teams**

* Enable *Keep Everything* in Slack Enterprise settings to ensure capture of edited and deleted messages.

* Use **auto-sync mode** for continuous ingestion and future-proof coverage of new users or channels.

* Leverage **custodian-based collections** for targeted investigations or regulatory holds.

* Utilize **in-place preservation** with ILH to maintain defensible data integrity without immediate exports.

### **For Admins**

* Ensure required permissions and OAuth scopes are granted.

* Configure retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements (e.g., SEC 17a-4, FINRA).

## **Integration Best Practices**

* Regularly audit connection health and sync status using available logs.

* Map Slack user identities to corporate identity management systems to unify cross-platform searches.

* Monitor and manage file versioning in high-collaboration environments where documents are frequently edited.

* Validate huddle and canvas metadata integrity if used as part of case evidence.
