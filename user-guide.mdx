### Step 2: Create an Application

A central container for managing and monitoring each application’s security policies and guardrails. Every application starts with a default policy called “Launch,” which you can modify or remove as needed. The “Launch” policy consists of the following advance guardrails

- Toxicity Detection
- PII Detection
- Jailbreak Detection
- Profenitiy Detection
